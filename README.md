What is it
----------

In short, Stacksmith is a HyperCard clone that runs on the current version of Mac OS X.


How to build
------------

Make sure you've inited all the submodules, and then just build the Stacksmith Xcode project.


License
-------

I'm still thinking about a license to open source this under. Some of the code used in Stacksmith is under the zlib license, but I'm not sure I want to be that liberal with Stacksmith proper.

Right now, consider all of this copyrighted and non-distributable until I've made a decision.

I'm open to well-reasoned suggestions, though.
