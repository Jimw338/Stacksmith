What is it
----------

In short, Stacksmith is a HyperCard clone that runs on the current version of Mac OS X.


How to build
------------

I'm still working on making this build more easily. Right now, you need to check out

	UliKit
	
	Leonie
	
	Forge
	
	ForgeDebugger
	
	Stacksmith
	
	stackimport
	
	UKSyntaxColoredTextDocument
	
	UKPaintView
	
	Sparkle
	
	ULIMelodyQueue
	
	ULINetSocket
	
into one folder, next to each other, so the Stacksmith project file will find them.


License
-------

I'm still thinking about a license to open source this under. Some of the code used in Stacksmith is under the zlib license, but I'm not sure I want to be that liberal with Stacksmith proper.

Right now, consider all of this copyrighted and non-distributable until I've made a decision.

I'm open to well-reasoned suggestions, though.
