## What is Stacksmith?

Stacksmith is an open source project aiming to create a modern HyperCard. A software erector kit that allows beginners to quickly learn to create their own apps, and that stays flexible and powerful enough that it can be used as a development environment for professionals. The main goal of Stacksmith is to be *humane*, to think like a person does instead of making a person think like a computer.

## Contributors

Want to help? We'd appreciate any help, but in particular:

1. <b>Programmers</b> (C/C++ for the core, on Mac also Objective-C and CIFilters for the visual effects) who would like to add to Stacksmith or port it to other platforms
2. <b>Graphics designers</b> HyperCard came with ~ 200 icons, and we'd like to provide modern, high-resolution substitutes for each one. You'd also work with the UX designer to do the rest of the UI and developing a common design language for all built-in components.
3. <b>Technical writers</b> Mainly for end-user documentation for Stacksmith users, tutorials and such, but also for API documentation for the programming team.
4. <b>UX designers</b> To be honest, Stacksmith is very ugly and quite 90ies at the moment, and the web sites could be more on point. We'd also love your help and suggestions on improving the editor interface.
5. <b>Admins and web wizards</b> Someone who looks after our infrastructure. Moving the language reference off WordPress to Jekyll, maybe set up a better Jenkins installation, static analyzer, etc. Maybe someone who makes a Jekyll set-up that generates both the language reference web site and a Stacksmith version of it.
6. <b>Community managers</b> Few people are aware of Stacksmith yet. Most think this is just a HyperCard clone. We need your enthusiasm to help us get the news out there that Stacksmith is the future, not the past. Right now we need more people to do development. In the future, that might be making users aware of Stacksmith.
7. <b>Sample stack authors</b> HyperCard came with lots of readymade "Card Ideas" and the like. If you made a single-card sample that is useful as a template for beginners or even a full stack that is a fun showcase, and is well-commented, send it to us, and who knows, it might ship as one of the future Stacksmith templates.

You can find the source code in [the Stacksmith Github repository](https://github.com/uliwitness/Stacksmith). You can find more information about its programming language, <i>Hammer</i>, at <a href="http://hammer-language.org" target="_blank">Hammer-Language.org</a>, including a mission statement, and <a href="apidocs/index.html">documentation</a> of the source code on this site.

We also have a [Stacksmith mailing list and forum](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/stacksmith) where development, design etc. are discussed.
