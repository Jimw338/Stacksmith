We're here to further the cause of teaching people to program, and advance the state of programming so it works more like humans do. As such, we want, no <i>need</i> people from every walk of life. Pink, black, male, female, undecided, left-handed, trans, homosexual, ... -- we value your viewpoint. We have a common goal, to bring app creation to more people, and make it more pleasant.

If someone prevents you from doing that, or harasses you, let Uli know and it'll be dealt with to restore a fun and safe working environment.
